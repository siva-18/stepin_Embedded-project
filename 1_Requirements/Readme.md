SEAT HEATING APPLICATION-------
--> This project name is Seat Heating Application. --> In this project we are designing a car seat heater using a microcontroller. --> For that we are doing 3 activities.

ACTIVITY-1:
---> In Activity-1 we are connecting 2 buttons for atmega328. ---> In that 2 buttons 1 is button sensor is used to say whether the passenger is seated or not. ---> Led Actuator shows the driver is seated. ---> Another one is heater button which is used to detect the heat. ---> Heater will check the heater button is ON. ACTIVITY-2:
---> In Activity-2 we get the detected temperature. ---> we can increase or decrease the temperature by using switch or a button. ---> we can set it to either minimum or maximum values. ---> example: In the range of (20%-33%)

ACTIVITY-3:
---> In Activity-3 it displays the value of temperature as output. --->Display CDD-CRO will give the temperature value by showing PWM .
