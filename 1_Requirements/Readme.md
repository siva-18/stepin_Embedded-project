SEAT HEATING APPLICATION-------
--> This project name is Seat Heating Application. --> In this project we are designing a car seat heater using a microcontroller. --> For that we are doing 4 activities.

ACTIVITY-1:
---> In Activity-1 we are connecting 2 buttons for atmega328. ---> In that 2 buttons 1 is button sensor is used to say whether the passenger is seated or not. ---> Led Actuator shows the driver is seated. ---> Another one is heater button which is used to detect the heat. ---> Heater will check the heater button is ON.

ACTIVITY-2:
---> In Activity-2 we get the detected temperature.
---> we can increase or decrease the temperature by using switch or a button.
---> we can set it to either minimum or maximum values.
---> example: In the range of (20%-33%)
---> In Activity-2 we need to get ADC.

ACTIVITY-3:
---> In Activity-3 it displays the value of temperature as output. --->Display CDD-CRO will give the temperature value by showing PWM .

ACTIVITY-4:
---> In Activity-4 in other cases LED light turn off.
